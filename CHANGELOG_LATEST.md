# Latest Changelog - Full Customization Update

## Date: October 21, 2025

### 🎉 Major Feature: Complete Series and Axis Customization

This update transforms the Graph Creator into a **fully customizable, real-time** graphing application.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: Limited Series Editing
**Problem**: Previously, you could only:
- Toggle series visibility
- Adjust line width
- Change line style

**Solution**: Now you can customize **everything**:
- ✅ Change which data column the series displays
- ✅ Edit series labels (independent of column names)
- ✅ Pick custom colors with color picker
- ✅ Choose from 9 marker types (circle, square, triangle, diamond, star, etc.)
- ✅ Adjust marker size
- ✅ Control transparency/alpha
- ✅ Assign to primary or secondary Y-axis

### Issue #2: No X-Axis Labeling
**Problem**: Could not label the X-axis

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added X-axis label text field
- ✅ Added X-axis scale control (Linear/Log)
- ✅ Added X-axis min/max range controls

### Issue #3: Incomplete Customization
**Problem**: Missing many essential customization options

**Solution**: Added comprehensive controls for:
- ✅ Y-axis min/max ranges
- ✅ Secondary Y-axis configuration (auto-appears when needed)
- ✅ Data preview table (see your data before graphing)
- ✅ All changes update in **real-time** - no "Apply" button needed!
