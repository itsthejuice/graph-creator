# How to Run Graph Creator

## Super Simple Instructions ðŸš€

```bash
cd /home/admin/Projects/graph-creator
./run.sh
```

**That's literally it!** ðŸŽ‰

---

## What Will Happen

### First Time Running

```
1. Script checks you have Python 3.11+  âœ“
2. Creates virtual environment          âœ“
3. Installs all dependencies            âœ“ (takes 2-3 minutes)
4. Launches the application             âœ“
```

### Every Time After

```
1. Script checks setup is complete      âœ“
2. Launches the application             âœ“ (takes 2 seconds!)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "pip install -e ." fails with setuptools error

**Solution:** Already fixed! Just run:
```bash
./run.sh
```

The new `run.sh` script handles everything automatically.

### Problem: Need to start fresh

**Solution:**
```bash
./run.sh --clean
./run.sh
```

### Problem: Dependencies seem broken

**Solution:**
```bash
./run.sh --reinstall
```

---

## What Got Fixed

1. âœ… **Fixed setuptools error** - Added explicit package configuration
2. âœ… **Automated venv creation** - No more manual setup
3. âœ… **Smart dependency installation** - Only installs once
4. âœ… **Fast subsequent launches** - Skips setup when done
5. âœ… **Better error messages** - Know what went wrong
6. âœ… **Easy recovery** - `--clean` and `--reinstall` options
