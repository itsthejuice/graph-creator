# Quick Start Guide

## TL;DR - Get Started in 10 Seconds

```bash
cd /home/admin/Projects/graph-creator
./run.sh
```

**Done!** The application will open automatically.

---

## What the Script Does

The `run.sh` script is your all-in-one launcher that:

### First Run
1. âœ… Checks Python 3.11+ is installed
2. âœ… Creates virtual environment (`venv/`)
3. âœ… Installs all dependencies (~2-3 minutes)
4. âœ… Launches Graph Creator

### Subsequent Runs
1. âœ… Checks Python version
2. âœ… Uses existing virtual environment
3. âœ… Skips dependency installation (already done!)
4. âœ… Launches Graph Creator immediately

**Time to launch after first setup: ~2 seconds**

---

## Script Commands

```bash
# Run the application (normal usage)
./run.sh

# Clean everything and start fresh
./run.sh --clean

# Force reinstall dependencies
./run.sh --reinstall

# Show help
./run.sh --help
```

---

## First Time Setup Example

## Common Use Cases

### Just Run the App
```bash
./run.sh
```

### Start Fresh (Remove All Setup)
```bash
./run.sh --clean
./run.sh  # Fresh install
```

### Something Broken? Reinstall Dependencies
```bash
./run.sh --reinstall
```

### Stop the Application
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied"
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

### "Python 3.11 required"
Install Python 3.11 or higher:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11

# Or use your system's package manager
```

### "Virtual environment activation failed"
Try manual setup:
```bash
./run.sh --clean
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
python -m app.main
```

### Dependencies Installation Failed
Check internet connection and try:
```bash
./run.sh --reinstall
```

## File Structure

After first run, you'll see:

```
graph-creator/
â”œâ”€â”€ venv/              # Virtual environment (auto-created)
â”œâ”€â”€ .setup_complete    # Marker file (auto-created)
â”œâ”€â”€ app/               # Application code
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/             # Test suite
â”œâ”€â”€ run.sh             # This script!
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

**Note:** `venv/` and `.setup_complete` are git-ignored.

---

## Manual Alternative

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# One-time setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Every time you want to run
source venv/bin/activate
python -m app.main
```

But honestly, just use `./run.sh` â€” it's easier! ðŸ˜Š
