# Latest Bug Fixes - October 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Add Series Button Now Working
**Problem:** Clicking the "Add Series" button did nothing - no new series were added.

**Solution:**
- Implemented `_rebuild_section()` method that updates only the affected section without rebuilding the entire sidebar
- This preserves scroll position and ensures proper UI updates
- Add Series now correctly adds available data columns to the chart

**How to Use:**
1. Load data or use an example dataset
2. Click the "Add Series" button in the Series section
3. The next available column will be added as a new series

### 2. ✅ Series Delete Now Working
**Problem:** Clicking the delete button on a series did nothing.

**Solution:**
- Fixed the series deletion to use the new `_rebuild_section()` method
- Series are now properly removed from both the UI and the chart
- Each series has a delete button (trash icon) that removes it when clicked

**How to Use:**
1. Click the trash icon on any series card
2. The series will be removed immediately
3. The chart will update to reflect the removal

### 3. ✅ Blank Charts Have No Pre-Made Series
**Problem:** Creating a blank chart still auto-generated series, defeating the purpose of a blank slate.

**Solution:**
- Modified `_build_series_section()` to skip auto-creation for data sources named "Blank"
- Blank charts now start with zero series
- Users can manually add series using the "Add Series" button

**How to Use:**
1. Click "New Blank Graph"
2. No series will be pre-created
3. Use "Add Series" to manually add the data you want to visualize

### 4. ✅ Annotations Fully Customizable
**Problem:** Annotations could only be toggled on/off, not customized.

**Solution:**
- Added dropdown to select annotation type when adding (Horizontal Line, Vertical Line, Text Label, Horizontal Span, Vertical Band)
- Each annotation type now has editable parameters:
  - **Horizontal Line:** Y Value, Color
  - **Vertical Line:** X Value, Color
  - **Text Label:** Text, X position, Y position
  - **Horizontal Span:** X Min, X Max, Color
  - **Vertical Band:** Y Min, Y Max, Color
- Parameter controls appear when annotation is enabled
- All changes update the chart in real-time

**How to Use:**
1. In the Annotations section, select the type of annotation from the dropdown
2. Click "Add" button
3. Enable the annotation with the checkbox
4. Edit the parameters in the text fields that appear
5. Changes apply immediately to the chart

### 5. ✅ Sidebar No Longer Scrolls to Top
**Problem:** Clicking buttons (add/delete series, add/delete annotations) would reset the sidebar scroll position to the top, making it difficult to work on items lower in the list.

**Solution:**
- Implemented targeted section rebuilding with `_rebuild_section()` method
- Only the affected section (Series or Annotations) is updated, not the entire sidebar
- Scroll position is preserved across all operations
- The scrollable column (`sections_column`) maintains its state

**Technical Details:**
- Stored reference to the scrollable sections column
- Each section has an index (0-6) for targeted updates
- Section rebuilds update only the necessary controls
- Full refresh is only used when loading new examples or projects

## Files Modified

### `app/ui/builder.py`
- Added `self.page` attribute for page reference
- Added `self.sections_column` to track the scrollable container
- Implemented `_rebuild_section(section_index)` for targeted updates
- Updated all add/delete operations to use targeted rebuilding
- Enhanced annotation controls with type-specific parameter editors
- Added annotation type selector dropdown
- Updated `refresh()` to only rebuild the sections column

### `app/main.py`
- Fixed blank chart initialization to not auto-create series
- Set default X column for blank charts

## Testing Results

All fixes have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Add series button adds new series correctly
- ✅ Delete series button removes series correctly
- ✅ Blank charts start with no series
- ✅ Annotations can be fully customized with all parameters
- ✅ Sidebar scroll position stays in place during all operations
- ✅ UI remains responsive and updates smoothly

## Usage Tips

1. **Managing Series:**
   - Use "Add Series" to add new data columns to your chart
   - Click the trash icon to remove unwanted series
   - Toggle visibility with the checkbox to temporarily hide series

2. **Customizing Annotations:**
   - Select the annotation type before adding
   - Enable annotations to see their parameter controls
   - Use color names (red, blue, green) or hex codes (#FF0000)
   - Adjust positions and ranges to highlight specific data points

3. **Working Efficiently:**
   - The sidebar now maintains scroll position
   - You can quickly add/remove multiple items without losing your place
   - All changes update the chart in real-time
